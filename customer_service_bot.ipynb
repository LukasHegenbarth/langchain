    "I was on the fence for a long time about getting these. The price was definitely a scare factor. However I recently bought an Apple Watch and the headphones compliment the watch perfectly. Especially for exercise. The AirPods Pro sound very good for their size. Battery life is acceptable and I can easily connect them to my Apple TV, Watch, iPhone etc…\n",
    "They stay in place (I’m a commuter cyclist) with no issues and have never fallen out at the gym either. I will say the volume control on mine is quite finicky but I don’t know if that’s an isolated issue with mine. I love how loud these get as well as the ability to bring the charging case to ‘top up’ the AirPod Pros on the go. If using with an iPhone, you can wander a fair distance away before any connection issues happen. Which is great. Cleaning them is a breeze too. By far my favourite feature is the noise cancelling option. Pretty much worth the price of admission by its self.\"\"\""
